# Jaqueline's Blog Project


## Description
I used about 14 hours to finish, needs some improvement but it was great adition to my learning.

## Usage
-In the 'nav' bar we have a icon "‚òÄÔ∏è" to see the page in light mode and "üåõ" to see the dark mode, when the user insert their username, title ,content and click submit , they'll be able to post in the blog page.
there's footer with my portfolio link, my email and github page.
- In the blog page there's a back button, the dark/ light toggle button and a button to clear posts (that button will clean the just posts from the local storage when refresh the page, not the fixed post).
